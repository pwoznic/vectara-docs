Vectara Chat provides an interactive user experience that enables you to build 
domain-specific chatbots using RAG, while maintaining user privacy and data 
security. Vectara Chat remembers chat histories and leads to more relevant 
responses in different scenarios like customer support. 

Every Vectara account has a unique Chat History Corpus which stores all chat 
histories. You can enable chat in the Query tab of specific corpora.

The Conversations page lists the conversations in your chat history corpus:
