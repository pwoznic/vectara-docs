The Vectara Prompt Engine empowers Scale users to customize prompts that can 
reference the most relevant text and metadata for use cases that require 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Vectara enables developers to directly 
add the retrieved documents and their metadata into the prompt generation.
Vectara supports [Velocity Templates](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/user-guide.html) which offer 
developers a flexible way of customizing prompts and enhance the effectiveness 
of their generative AI applications. 

This capability unlocks more advanced workflows and customizations to answer 
questions about your business data. Answer questions based on previous 
answers, such as with RFI, RFP, and questionnaires. Draft support tickets from 
user feedback. You can even customize the formatting of results.

## Prompt Design Principles

Effective prompts guide LLMs to generate responses that meet specific user 
needs or objectives in generative AI applications. Define an objective 
that outlines what you aim to achieve, and provide detailed context to 
enrich the prompts with nuanced background information to help the AI 
understand the scenario better. Iteration and refinement are important 
processes to help you improve the outcome of your prompts.

## Effective Prompt Design

Prompts typically include a specific a `role` and `content` about the role, 
which provide context about the kind of information that you want to retrieve. 
These values can also specify variables and functions to provide more nuanced 
context. You then add different operations to customize the types of answers 
you want to retrieve.

### Role

The `role` specifies the function of the individual or entity that you want to 
respond to the prompt. This function indicates the responsibilities and 
perspective of the action being performed.

Example roles can also System, Software Developer, Product Owner, 
Technical Writer, Data Analyst, Customer Support Representative.

You can specify the role as `system` and then have the `content` value 
as `You are a helpful search assistant.` You could also specify the platform 
or environment within which you want the prompt issued and subsequent action 
taken. The platforms can range from software applications to physical systems. 
Providing details about the system provides additional context for the 
response.

Example systems can include a Content Management System, Code Repository, 
Learning Management System, Business Intelligence Software, and so on.

### Content

The `content` provides more information about the role and what you expect the 
entity to perform. This is crucial when you have loops and iterations in your 
prompts, like in our example. For each loop, specify the precise action or 
feedback desired from the prompt. Capture the context of what needs to be accomplished or 
directed. Clear and concise content helps ensure that the prompt communicates 
its intent effectively.

Example content can include:

* "Follow up on a refund request"
* "Update the monthly sales dashboard"
* "Determine the cause of the network failure"
* "Create a technical documentation outline for a new feature"
* "Provide the top 10 trends from the product backlog"

## Example Prompt Template

The following example prompt specifies a role as a helpful search assistant. 
It then loops through Vectara query results with specific variables and 
functions. Finally, it generates a summary for the query. 

```javascript
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful search assistant."},
  #foreach ($qResult in $vectaraQueryResults)
     {"role": "user", "content": "Give me the $vectaraIdxWord[$foreach.index] search result."},
     {"role": "assistant", "content": "${qResult.getText()}" },
  #end
  {"role": "user", "content": "Generate a summary for the query \"${vectaraQuery}\" based on the above results."}
]
```


## Available Variables and Functions

* `vectaraQueryResults` - results of a query
* `vectaraIdxWord` - array of the first 10 ordinals (first, second, third, etc)
* `vectaraQuery` - userâ€™s search query
* `vectaraLangCode` - specific language code
* `vectaraLangName` - specific language
* `vectaraOutChars` - character limit for the output
* `vectaraChatHistory` - history of turns within a chat conversation
