Here’s where we keep you up to date with all the latest features and product 
documentation updates to help you get even more out of the Vectara platform. 
Whether you're building sophisticated GenAI applications, experimenting with 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), or exploring our newest API endpoints, 
this page is your go-to place to see how we’re evolving and how these product 
and documentation changes can benefit your enterprise.


## Search Cutoffs and Limits
_October 9, 2024_

This feature introduces cutoffs and limits for search results. Cutoffs set a 
minimum relevance threshold, while limits control the maximum number of 
returned results after reranking. These can be applied individually or 
combined across various reranker types.

**Why it matters:** These controls allow developers to customize reranker inputs, 
ensuring highly relevant results and optimizing resource usage. By enabling 
more precise result filtering, application builders have more flexibility for 
specific use cases, from content categorization to focused data retrieval.

### Updated API endpoint(s): 

* Advanced Single Corpus Query | Vectara Docs
* Multiple Corpora Query | Vectara Docs 

### More information: 

* Search cutoffs
* Search limits

## Chain reranker
_October 8, 2024_ 

The Vectara chain reranker lets you apply multiple reranking strategies 
sequentially, allowing users to combine different reranking strategies and 
giving you absolute control. This feature enables the application of diverse 
ranking criteria at each stage of the ranking process, from neural reranking 
and maximal marginal relevance to custom business logic, all in a customizable 
sequence.

Why it matters: This unique innovation addresses complex search scenarios that 
require multidimensional relevance and enables enterprises to fully customize 
Vectara's behavior. By allowing the combination of various reranking 
strategies, it significantly enhances the quality of Retrieval Augmented 
Generation (RAG) outcomes. This addresses a significant gap in the GenAI 
market, offering a solution that analysts have identified as crucial for 
advanced AI-driven search and retrieval systems.

### Updated API endpoint(s): 

* Advanced Single Corpus Query | Vectara Docs
* Multiple Corpora Query | Vectara Docs

## Document and Document Part/Vector Count API

_October 1, 2024_

You can now retrieve more comprehensive metrics about a corpus, including the 
number of documents or document parts (vectors).

**Why it matters:** Administrators can now efficiently manage resource allocation 
and monitor data usage trends. This feature helps ensure that corpus growth 
stays within allocated quotas and provides insights into document segmentation 
patterns.

### More information:

* Get Corpus API Definition 
* Retrieve metadata about a corpus 

## GovCloud Launch
_September 11, 2024_

## UI Enhancement: Custom Prompts in Console

_August 20, 2024_

The Vectara Prompt Engine allows users to create customized prompt templates 
that can reference relevant text and metadata for Retrieval Augmented 
Generation (RAG) applications.

Why it matters: This feature enables more advanced workflows and 
customizations for creating context-aware responses, such as answering 
questions based on previous answers in RFIs or RFPs, drafting support tickets 
from user feedback, and customizing result formatting. The ability to define 
roles and provide detailed context in prompts helps guide LLMs to generate 
more accurate and relevant responses.

## User Defined Function Reranking
_August 15, 2024_

Vectara introduced User Defined Function Reranking, giving enterprises more 
granular control over search result ordering by applying custom ranking logic, 
such as sorting by price, date, or any custom metadata. This flexibility is 
particularly useful for e-commerce and enterprise search applications.

## Vectara API v2  
_June 6, 2024_

The Vectara API v2 provides a more RESTful, intuitive structure with simpler 
authentication, new top-level objects, and better defaults for hybrid search 
and reranking, making it easier to develop applications with Vectara’s GenAI 
platform.

## Vectara Multilingual Reranker v1 (Slingshot)  
_May 28, 2024_

The state-of-the-art Vectara Multilingual Reranker, also known as Slingshot, 
provides more accurate neural ranking than the initial Boomerang retrieval. 
While computationally more expensive, it offers improved text scoring across a 
wide range of languages, making it suitable for diverse content. Slingshot 
boosts enterprise search quality, especially in globally distributed 
organizations.
